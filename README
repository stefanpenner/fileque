NamedPipe
==============

A class that manages a simple named-pipe resource
on a Unix filesystem. This class is essentially a
nice abstraction over the "easy to forget" details
of working with named pipes on that 30 year old 
API we call Unix.

The system is designed to be resilient and safe
for multi-process use. It is meant to be used
as a component in a larger project.
